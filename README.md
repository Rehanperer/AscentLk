# ASCENT 2026 🚀

This is the official website for **ASCENT 2026**, the biggest student-led Esports tournament in Sri Lanka. I built this from scratch to bring a high-tech, "Valorant-inspired" aesthetic to life on the web.

## ⚡ Tech Stack

I used the latest tech to make sure it's fast and smooth:
*   **React + Vite**: For blazing fast performance.
*   **TypeScript**: To keep the code clean and bug-free.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: For all the custom styling and that "tactical" look.
*   **Framer Motion**: This is what powers all the sick animations (scroll reveals, timeline, parallax).
*   **Fly.io**: Where I deployed it (Dockerized setup).

## 🎨 Key Features I Built

*   **Interactive Hero Section**: A video background that expands on scroll with a glitch effect title.
*   **Animated Timeline**: A custom-built "Path to Ascent" timeline that draws itself as you scroll down.
*   **Tactical HUD Effects**: Scramble text effects, corner brackets, and a custom cursor that feels like you're in the game.
*   **Performance Optimized**: 
    *   Lazy loading for heavy components (so it loads fast).
    *   Throttled scroll events for smoother 60fps animations.
    *   Optimized particle system background.

## 🛠️ How to Run It Locally

If you want to check out the code:

1.  **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rehanperer/AscentLk.git
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the dev server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🚀 Deployment

I set up a **Dockerfile** and **Nginx** configuration to serve the app as a static site.
